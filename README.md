# TSConnect

Your command center to everything Taylor Swift!

## Installation

Installing is easy!

### Installing latest release

1. Go to the releases tab
2. Find the latest release
3. Install the package for your OS

### Installing previous versions

Installing previous versions is risky, and should be avoided.

1. Set the `TSC_TESTING` environmental variable to `true`(This should be a string)
2. Find the release that you want to install
3. Install the package for your OS

The TSC_TESTING environmental variable skips the auto update, thus will maintain the desired version.
